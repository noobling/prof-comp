## Discussed the Extent to Which the Project has Met the Sprint 2 Goals
[3:05]

Discussed sprint 1 user stories document and the extent to which we have met the goals we set. The client confirmed we had met all of the intermediate goals.

[x] The user can enter their code in one of the the apps [This was changed from code to username/password + email scheme to log-in in order to better meet the needs of users.]

[x] There is a form that can be filled out to record a sleep diary record and the form should be the Consensus Sleep Diary-M table.

[x] The sleep diary records are stored indefinitely on a MYSQL database located in the cloud.

[x] The sleep diary records can only be accessed by the user that created it and the researcher who has that user as their patient.

[x] Only a researcher can download a userâ€™s sleep diary. That user also has to be a patient of that researcher.

[x] The data a researcher downloads should be in excel format.

[x] There is a way to edit and delete sleep diary records and only users who created the record and researcher can do that.

[x] All sensitive data is securely stored and only accessed by appropriate
people:

* Names and emails can only be viewable to the user which the account belongs to and their researcher [Names are not stored]

* Codes are only viewable by the user which the code [username] represents and the researcher who assigned them the code [who referred them to the app]

[x] There is a way to invite users to use the app through sending them an email.

[x] The app will be available on a website and can also be accessed on a mobile device by directly transfering the mobile app.

[x] The interface to use the app should be simple to use and intuitive with minimal instructions needed.

Client seemed happy with our progress on the app overall.
