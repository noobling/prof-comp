## Introduction
Android is progressing, but has some bugs.

iOS is having major issues.

Website is progressing very well.

## What each team member did last week

### Michael

Worked on the survey for iOS.

* Implemented all questions

* Correct answer formats

* Started implementing JSON object conversion

### David

Worked on documentation for client.

Made changes client wanted:

* Made picker for the website more accurate (to the minute)

* PWA works

### Taige

Worked on the non-linear survey.

### Zihao

Work on HTTP protocols and found mild success, but only works on the debugger so far.

Thinks he can finish the app by the due date of sprint 3.

### Joshua

Finished the visual side of the questionnaire.

* Extra info text implemented

No backend validation though.

## Discussed iOS

Major problems with ResearchKit.

Lack of time to finish the other features.

We will present the PWA to the client instead, but will aim to finish the survey module.

## Discussed issues with contacting client

Away until 22nd October (when sprint 2 is due).

Unit Coordinator said all work must be submitted by Monday night.

## Plan of action to wrap up sprint 3

David is willing to finish the documentation of the app. Wants us to proof-read his work though.

Time analysis will be done individually and compiled into a single document.

## Action items

David will list all the documentation to be done specifically.
