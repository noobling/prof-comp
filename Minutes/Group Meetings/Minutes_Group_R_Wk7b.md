* iOS
	* iOS App inexperience in development
		* Solution options:
			* Drop it
			* Reassign people
				* Michael may jump on
			* Change expectations of app
				* Consult risk register
			* Use a PWA app
				* Difference: donâ€™t DL from the store
				* Disadvantage:
					* Still a web app
					* Cannot access native features as well.
                * Advantages:
				    * Easy to implement
					* Has a native feel
			* Possibility of using PWA as a fail-safe if Adam comes back
			* If PWA is implemented instead
				* Taige will jump onto Android dev
			* Communicate with Adam ask what is going on
	
* Long Text Issue
    * Not displaying nicely
	* Can be fine tuned in Sprint 3
    * Can reduce font size 

* Responsive Design
	* Possible solution: choose a framework that supports responsive layout
		
* Communication between app and server (android)
	* Possible Solutions:
		* Use a HTTP library
			 * XHR library (JS, Ajax)
			* HTTP requests backend on Android app
		* Do more research
	
* Delivery of App to Users
	* Website can be easily delivered
	* Mobile apps going to be expensive
	    * Alternate Options:
			* APK link on website
			* Rely on client to distribute
            * Split the cost with team
        * Auditor says:
            * Our unit is tasked with making a working app, and deployment is beyond the unit, but can be considered by the team if they wish to take the extra step.
