## Presenting the Final Product PWA

Gave the client the UAT document to sign off on

Downloaded the app on the client's phone for her to see it in action

Features we discussed

* Shows the data recorded

* Not calculated values, user input

* Visualisations

* Pre-filling for reusable  data

* Better time pickers

* Added extra information for each question

* Optional landscape orientation

* User-friendly UI

Clarified the distinction between admin and patient users

She suggested only sleep science email addresses be able to access admin accounts

## Presenting the Final Android Version

Only for patients to submit data to be website

Features

* More intuitive navigation

* Autofills current time data

* Would need to put on the android store to distribute it

## Client Retrospective

### Strengths

Communication with the client

The final app was successful

### Improvements

Communication amongst the team due to changing project manager roles and being a new group

Group emails, rather than individual emails to the project manager

### Looking Ahead

What to do if there are problems down the track

* There will always be small bugs

* We are willing to work on minor bugs

* David is willing to maintain it to an extent going forward

* The client understands she may need to call in more support for larger problems

We will hold onto details about it due to potential security issues in transferring the data

Domain names

* Domain name used is a free version, the client will need to pay some money to get a legitimate domain name

Speed of the website

* Would cost some money to make it run faster, but functions well enough for now

### Final Thoughts

Can understand the rationale behind the 3 sprints and found it successful as a project system

The final project is aesthetically  pleasing as well as being functional

Clear instructions from the unit coordinator on how to work with us, but the 'stories' representation of tasks was difficult to understand

The documents we used were foreign to the client's experience
