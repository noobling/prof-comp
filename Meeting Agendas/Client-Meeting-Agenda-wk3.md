# Client Meeting Agenda Week 3

## Items to be discussed/settled
* Core features client wishes to have
Grab the sleep diary m and digitalise it. Preferrably cross platform on iOS and android.

* Deliverables to be done before next meeting
* Is there a style guide, logo or branding requirements
* Should users choose user names or should they be assigned?

## Interesting ideas
* Visualise data to keep them engaged
* Sleep diary - m
* Want the data go to the doctor or relevant people
* Pre fill data with user profile
* Shouldn't have phones inside the bedroom
* Need to follow the paper exactly in order for researchers to use it

Issues 
* non compliance: Missing data or inaccurate
* Wrong day when entering in something like 1am they mean 8th of August but put 7th of August
