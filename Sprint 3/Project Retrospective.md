### Major Events

Adam leaving (and issues relating to it)

Missed auditor meeting

### Success Metric ($100 test)

* Record Sleep Data on web app  - SUCCESS

* Data Visualisation on Web App  - SUCCESS

* Notifications e.g. Reminder to record sleep data  - PASSABLE (Made email notifications)

* Convert data into excel format or similar (e.g. CSV) - SUCCESS

* Record Sleep Data on iOS App - PASSABLE (Using a PWA)

* Record Sleep Data on Android App - SUCCESS

* Compitable web app - SUCCESS

* Data Visualisation on Android App - UNSUCCESSFUL (Not a high priority)

* Data Visualisation on iOS App - SUCCESS (Using the PWA)

## Project Discussion

### Successes

Server

* Webserver using a framework that supports conversion to a PWA was a good choice

Android

* Overall it was a success, but some bugs still remain

Documentation

* During sprint 1

Good use of github

* Half of us didn't have experience with github before this project

### Challenges

Adam leaving

* iOS project was derailed for a while

* Lost a subject matter expert on iOS

* Down manpower

Client changing specifications added ~10 hours

* Privacy

* Selection systems

Android HTTP protocol

* Was a problem for 2-3 weeks, but was overcome eventually

Needing to learn a lot

* All iOS teammembers started with no knowledge

* Joshua had to learn with Zihao how to work on android

* Michael had to learn with David how to work on the webserver frameworks

* Learning through practical examples allowed us to learn quicker

Unclear project guidelines

* Which documents were required

* Overlapping purposes in sprint 1

### Other insights

* Got lucky by being able to pivot to a PWA rather than an iOS app

* Mentor was a lot of help, she sent us a lot of documents that helped with the project management and documentation. She also helped get us approval to use the UWA styling guide.

## Action for future projects

* More collaboration by coding together

* Communication cohesively and within sub-teams

* Create a coping plan in case the risks eventuate

* Learning through practical examples
