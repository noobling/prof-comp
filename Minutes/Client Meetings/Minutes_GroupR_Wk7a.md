## Similar Sleep Diary App
Jennifer says: 
* I have found an app similar to ours. Data gathered from a conference I attended last week. App developed by a British company
* UI
    * Usage of a visual analogue for some questions
	* Usage if a select button for entering time. 
		* Time cannot be entered via keypad.

David asked: 
* Can Jennifer send photos of the UI for some ideas

## User testing
David asked
* Can we send our app to users for user testing

Jennifer responds:
* Won’t test on actual participants due to ethical reasons
* Will test on someone that will mirror the target audience

David responds:
* Link will be shared with Jenifer
* App to test will be sent out in the next two weeks

## App (website) Demo
Jenifer gives feedback for current website:
* You [Team R] can decide on the style of the app
* Login
    * Don’t go with identification
	* Can use email and password for login
* Data that cannot be stored
	* All personal data besides emails cannot be stored
* Clinicians should not be de-identified
* Researchers should not be de-identified
* The current layout of the website is fine
* It would be nice to have a time select where you can scroll upwards to select times as well as downwards, similar to Doodle
	* e.g. Time start at midday to midday the next day
    * Maybe a checkbox that says past midnight?
* Make the arrows larger for number pickers
    * David responds: it is the default browser setting so it could be difficult to change
* Zihao shows an alternate time picker on Android
    * Jennifer says that is fine
* Include some graphs such as a graph of people's sleep times
* Fine with everything we will start testing to see how everything goes
	
## Identification at sleep science
Jennifer says:
* Each trial patient number is different for each trial
* Each trial starts at 1
* Hard to track specific patients
* Can be tracked via date filters

## Sprint 2
Michael asks: 
* Do we need to send the app to you by then (Monday Week) or do we also require feedback?

Jennifer responds: 
* I am not sure but I will send feedback for you

Michael will check with unit coordinator
