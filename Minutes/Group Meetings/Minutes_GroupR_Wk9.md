## David goes over making calls to the API server
* David mentions that this will be the most difficult task for everyone building the mobile apps (hooking into the API server)
* David shows everyone an example way of figuring out how to make calls to the API server
* David notes the following pertinent facts
    * Using the browsers developer tools to figure out how to make calls to the API server
    * Go to the network tab to see all the calls to the API Server
    * The key information to pay attention to is the: request URL, method, Authorization header, and schema of the payload
    * Use Postman to make HTTP calls
    * The implementation in the mobile app will be something similar to the HTTP call in Postman
