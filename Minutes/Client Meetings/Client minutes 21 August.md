[12:00] Meeting start

[12:05]
Clinicians + researchers will have the same level of access
Scenarios:

Research study:

* Access to everyone's identified data
* Access to data as anonymous users

* Sending data to other researchers using a (deidentified) randomised key

Security Implications

* Attatching number to name, what if a hacker gets it.

[12:10]
Separate data based on who has access to it
Some may want to be able to identify it
Casual users can be asked if they want their data used for research (anonymous)

[12:15]
May need to seperate raine studies, small studies, etc.
Security measures
Need for a 'superadmin' account to specify which admin accounts have access to which data

[12:20]
Extra features:

* Snoring detector (intensity + frequency of snoring) + analytics (Optional in settings)
* Light sensor + analytics (More useful for lights) (Optional in settings)
* Visualisation - Sleep duration, time to bed, actigraphy (bar levels), subjective sleep efficiency ((Total sleep time/total time in bed) * 100)
* Go to after alarm
* Extra info after questions

App: Snorelab - Use as a template?

[12:25]
Clinician - Simplified info (Total sleep time)

[12:35]
GANTT charts suggested for use
