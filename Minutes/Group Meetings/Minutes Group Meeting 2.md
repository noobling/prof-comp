# Matters arising from minutes of previous meeting

- Adam and David should finalise the Risk Register

# General business

[3:05] Zihao demonstrated his draft for the app.

[3:08] Joshua discussed ideas: Drinks calculator, extra info for questions as pop-up if you click on the questions.

[3:10] David arrived and we began the meeting officially.

[3:15] Decided on audited group meeting as Thursday (23rd) at 1pm at Clough.

[3:17] Zihao used visual studio + android studio for his proof of concept android app. Adam uses Xcode for his iOS apps.

[3:20] Discussed how to implement user accounts - Clinic generated codes to bind users to clinic (Not username + password).

[3:30] Zihao estimates it could take 1-2 weeks to create the android app because he has previously created a similar app. Adam questions the extent to which he will draw from the previous work.

[3:35] Adam will deliver to us the iOS frameworks and such required for the app.

[3:35] If the client wants the app on the app store, the client must pay $150 for an apple developers lisence. Or $50 for an android developer account. Perhaps UWA has an account that would be willing to use it. We can show it off to the client using 'test flight'.

[3:40] Server: Backend database will be SQL. Should we convert to excel for storage or just when sending it?

[3:40] Roles desired:

* Server: David, Adam
* Android: Zihao, Joshua
* iOS: Adam

* Taige wants to work with java
* Michael will go wherever

[3:50] Progress on Sprint 1 and what to complete:

* Scope of work progressing well, just requires finalization and client approval
* Skills audit done. Resource audit must be done soon.
* Risk Register template has been made but requires filling.
* Project acceptance tests assigned to Michael, Adam, Zihao.
* Set of stories assigned to David, Taige, Joshua.

[4:00] Agree to use slack for future communication. Group set up slack on laptop and mobile.

[4:10] Meeting officially ajourned
