# User stories for sprint 3

These are the features we wish to deliver by the end of Sprint 3. They will probably change as we progress.

* As a user I want the app to have no obvious bugs that have a detriment to my experience but I understand that there maybe obscure bugs that exist.

* As a user I want to be able to visualise my sleep diary data because I will find this interesting

* As a user I want to be able to change my login email because I may want to use a new email

* As a user I want to be able to reset my password incase I can't login

* As a user I want to be able to scroll upwards to pick my time as well as downwards because this makes more intuitive sense to me

* As a user the app should be simple and easy to use for me.
