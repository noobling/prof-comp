# User Stories for Sprint 3

These are the features we wish to deliver by the end of Sprint 3. They will probably change as we progress due to the agile methodology we are using, but they provide our current assessment of the major tasks left to complete.

## Stories for the Client

As a user, I want the app to have no obvious bugs that have a detriment to my experience, but I understand that there maybe obscure bugs that exist.

* We will place more focus on testing for sprint 3 in order to ensure the product delivered is of a high enough quality.

As a user, I want to be able to visualise my sleep diary data because I will find this interesting.

* We will delegate a team member to lead this feature because several subtasks must be completed as part of it:

    * Layout design and mock-ups
    * Coding into application
    * User testing to ensure it is intuitive to understand

As a user, I want to be able to change my login email because I may want to use a new email.

* We will reassess the priority of this task and assign a member to it (using Github issues) to ensure it is completed.

As a user, I want to be able to reset my password incase I can't login.

* We will reassess the priority of this task and assign a member to it (using Github issues) to ensure it is completed.

As a user, I want to be able to scroll upward (on the web app) to pick my time as well as downward because this makes more intuitive sense to me.

* We will increase the priority of this task and assign a member to it (using Github issues) to ensure it is completed.

As a user, the app should be simple and easy to use for me.

* We will place more focus on user testing for sprint 3 in order to ensure the product delivered is intuitive to users. We will also add user, researcher and admin documentation to allow external users to more fully understand the system.

As an organisation, the app should be maintainable moving forward.

* We will also place emphasis on documentation to provide maintainability after we have finished work on the project. This will allow other developers to interact with the software more easily. The server will also continue to be hosted.

## Summary of Tasks

* Extensive testing

* Visualisation of data

* Account customisation after initial log-in

* Tweaks to UI to increase usability

* Documentation for both end-users and developers
